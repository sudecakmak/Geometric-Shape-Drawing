# Geometric-Shape-Drawing
Menu driven program that draws the coordinate system and geometric shapes on the console screen.

## Project Description

The program ask the user to choose one of the following shapes:
- Line
- Parabola
- Circle

If the user chooses to draw a line program asks for the coefficients a and b that define the line on the coordinate system: y=ax+b

Similarly, for parabola, the program asks for the coefficients a, b and c that define the parabola on the coordinate system: y=ax^2+bx+c

Finally, for circle,  the program asks for the radius(r) and center(a,b) to define circle on the coordinate system: (x-a)^2+(y-b)^2=r^2

After getting required parameters, the program draws the coordinate system on the console screen using - and | characters, draws the geometric shape using * character.

Both x and y values in the coordinate system is range at least in [-10,10].
